# Take Home Assignment

Hello, thank you for all your time. I have created this repo in the hopes of making this the most easily shared response to the assignment. 

I have created a markdown file for the manual tests (including a bug report I found while writing the tests) which is located here: [Manual Testing page](https://github.com/noxferatu/takehomeassignment/blob/main/cloud_manual_test.md)

For the automation, I have done a combination of Selenium tests and Python/Selenium to show my thought processes at a first pass of testing the IDE. These tests are documented here: [Automation Test page](https://github.com/noxferatu/takehomeassignment/edit/main/automation_tests.md)

I really appreciate this opportunity and look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,

Kyle Gray
