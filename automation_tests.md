# Testing the RStudio Cloud with Automation:

**Notes:** I have written these tests as a Python script using Selenium and Chrome Webdriver. I have written it independently of a testing framework in the hopes that it will be more easily read. These tests depend on environmental variables to authenticate. 

## Code example:

[rscloud_automation.py](https://github.com/noxferatu/takehomeassignment/blob/main/rscloud_automation.py)

I have commented out the final test as it was not working. Validating code within the iFrame took me quite a while, but I was able to validate the IDE loaded, but I ran out of time attempting to run a demo within the console. I left my work to show my thought process on how I would test it and would love to figure out the best method to enter data into the console. (Who knows, perhaps I'll keep working at it and get a solution.)
